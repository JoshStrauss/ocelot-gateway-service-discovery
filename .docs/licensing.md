## Consul License

Consul was originally licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0). You can find the full text of the MPL 2.0 license [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/).

The MPL 2.0 is a free and open-source software license developed by the Mozilla Foundation. It is a weak copyleft license, which means that the source code of the licensed software must be made available under the same license, but it can be combined with other code under different licenses.

## Business Source License for Consul

Starting from Consul Version 1.17.0, the licensing has changed to the Business Source License (BSL) 1.1. Below is a summary of the key terms:

- **Licensor**: HashiCorp, Inc.
- **Licensed Work**: Consul Version 1.17.0 or later.
- **Additional Use Grant**: You may use the Licensed Work in production, provided it is not used to compete with HashiCorp's paid versions. A "competitive offering" is defined as a product offered to third parties on a paid basis that significantly overlaps with the capabilities of HashiCorp's paid versions.
- **Change Date**: Four years from the date the Licensed Work is published.
- **Change License**: After the Change Date, the license will change to the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0).

The BSL 1.1 is a source-available license that allows free use of the software for non-competitive purposes. After a specified period (four years in this case), the license will automatically convert to an open-source license (MPL 2.0).
